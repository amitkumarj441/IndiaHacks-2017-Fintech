# Parsec

### Idea 
```Building a web-scale state channel based on the existing web technologies used by large Internet companies like Uber, LinkedIn or Netflix for the Internet of Value. A web-scale solution for State Channels is needed to enable a layer of value transfer to the internet. Other proposals for State Channels include Raiden for Ethereum and Lightning Network for Bitcoin. However, we intend to leverage existing web-scale technologies used by large Internet companies like Uber, LinkedIn or Netflix.```

Contains the Parsec specification and an implementation of protocol using Apache Kafka.
